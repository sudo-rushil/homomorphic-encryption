Record of development of theoretical underpinnings of cryptosystem

## May 28, 2021

Definitions:
- Homomorphic system: encrypted data supports computation
- Multi-party system: adversarial users can aggregate encrypted data
- Matchmaking system: ?
Goals for system:
- Support two-person encryption
- Develop biomimetic algorithms for paired encryption
	- E.g. utilize the image of protein folding as a to-be-reduced NP-complete problem for an uninvertable lock
